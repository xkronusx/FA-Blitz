# The buffer size should be a relatively small amount. It's intended to smooth out network congestion and blips.
# Having a larger buffer is not better! The buffer will get cleared when the file is closed or if the file is seeked backwards.
        
# ⚠️ WARNING: 

# This is highly dependent on the amount of RAM and number of opened files.
# Apps open several files during library scans and each file open will consume up to the amount of RAM specified.
# If you set this too high and don't have enough free RAM, you will cause the mounts to crash!

# buffer-size should be smaller than the [vfs-read-chunk-size] to prevent too many requests from being sent when opening a file.

# Setting this too high will slow down scans and cause buffering with direct plays.

# RClone will always try to fill the buffer-size, so having it higher will slow down plex scans and loading the page for it in plex.
# Some plex clients open and close the file during playback, this means the buffer is constantly cleared.
# This is not the plex client buffer, that's controlled by the plex client.

# Set this value to 0 to disable the buffer.
        
# RECOMMENDATIONS:

# Set the buffer size to 1/2 the value of the read-chunk-size for the best results."
